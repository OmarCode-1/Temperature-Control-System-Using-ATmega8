# Temperature Control System Using ATmega8

Designed and implemented a temperature control system using the ATmega8 microcontroller to regulate and maintain a desired temperature environment. The system utilizes a multiplexer (MUX) to input the desired temperature value and an LM35 temperature sensor to measure the real-time temperature. The measured temperature is displayed on an LCD for real-time monitoring.

Key functionalities:

  1- Input the desired temperature value via a multiplexer.
  
  2- Compare the desired temperature with the real-time temperature reading from the LM35 sensor.
  
  3- If the desired temperature is higher than the real-time temperature, activate a heater to increase the temperature.
  
  4 - If the desired temperature is lower than the real-time temperature, activate a fan to cool down the environment.
  
  * Integrated an LCD to display the real-time and desired temperature values for user feedback.
